I started my programming journey when I was 12 years old. I was obsessed with video games and put many times into them, CS and L4D2 are my favourites too. During that time, I touched the programming step by step. I could contribute to the community, and exchange ideas with other developers. Currently, Iâ€™m trying to become a full-stack Javascript developer. Web development allows me to demonstrate creativity, create eye-catching animation and styling in numerous ways, turning designs into high-quality code. After over a year of study, I am ready to contribute to the world in this new way.'],
