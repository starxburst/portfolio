Programming gives me satisfaction. As a self-taught web developer, I always keep pushing myself to explore any new technology. My journey isnâ€™t over yet, with time I kept researching the current trends relevant in the field and started taking up online courses to expand the next project that I would build. The constant change and the opportunity to learn new aspects are really important for me. I have always found a certain satisfaction in programming and I knew I wanted to make a career in it.</h2>
